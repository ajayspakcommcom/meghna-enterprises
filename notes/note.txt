1. Browser Cache and Cookies
        Clear the browser’s cache and cookies on the specific machine, as outdated or corrupted data might interfere with the application.

2. Browser Compatibility
        Verify that the application is compatible with the browser version being used on the problem machine. Update or switch browsers to see if the error persists.

3. Network and Firewall Restrictions
        Check if there are any firewall or network restrictions on the machine that might block requests to the EC2 instance. 
        If using a corporate network, certain domains or ports might be restricted.
        
4. Check Application Logs
        Inspect the Next.js application logs on the EC2 instance for errors when the specific machine accesses it. 
        Logs can provide insight into issues like network requests, permissions, or data fetching problems.

5. CORS Issues
        If the application makes API calls, ensure that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured correctly to allow access from the specific machine’s IP or domain.

6. EC2 Security Groups and Inbound Rules
        Confirm that the EC2 instance’s security group allows inbound traffic from the specific machine’s IP, if access is IP-restricted.

7. Local DNS or Proxy Issues
        The specific machine might be using a proxy or DNS settings that could interfere with access. Try switching to a different network or checking DNS configurations.
